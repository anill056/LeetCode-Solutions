/*Intuition
The problem requires finding two numbers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given target. Instead of using brute force to check every pair (O(nÂ²) complexity), we can store each number's complement (target - nums[i]) in a hash map while iterating through the array. This allows us to check for the required pair in constant time O(1), making the overall solution much more efficient.

Approach
1.) Create a hash map (unordered_map<int, int>) to store numbers and their indices.

2.) Iterate through the array:

Compute the complement (target - nums[i]).
If the complement already exists in the hash map, return both indices.
Otherwise, store nums[i] with its index in the hash map for future lookups.

3.) Since a solution is guaranteed, the function always returns a valid pair.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(n)
